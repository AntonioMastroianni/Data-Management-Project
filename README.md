## About

This project explores the relationship between movie reviews and popularity by integrating and analyzing data from two major sources: IMDb and TMDB. Using datasets from Kaggle and IMDb APIs, we built a unified database that combines detailed movie attributes, user reviews, and ratings.  
Key steps involved data quality evaluation, schema transformation, conflict resolution, and the use of MongoDB for flexible document-based storage. We performed exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns in movie genres, review sentiments, and budget-to-rating correlations.  
This merged dataset allows for deeper insights into what makes a movie popular and how audience perception aligns with industry metrics.
The review dataset was taken from IMDb while the movies dataset was taken

## Technologies
- Python
- MongoDB

## Usage

In order to reproduce the project, it's important to connect to your own drive and place the data file in a folder named "Progetto 2" which is in turn contained in a folder named "Materiale Data Management". Moreover it's necessary to replace my own mongoDB credentials with yours.
